One reason is that four years at Yale cost more than $104,000, and although almost half of the freshmen receive some financial aid, many more applied for aid than received it. What, on balance, do these statistics add up to? "From the student\'s perspective, the question should be, \'What are the best options for me?\' " said the university\'s dean of admissions, Richard H.

Prof. Paula Armbruster, the director of outpatient services at the Yale Child Study Center, asks, "How can a child learn if she is depressed or frightened?" For Professor Armbruster the answer has been to take mental health services directly into schools to help 300 children from kindergarten through high school cope with serious problems. She assigns 20 psychiatric social work faculty members and trainees, most with master\'s degrees in social work, from the Yale Child Study Center to 30 New Haven public schools, about 70 percent of the schools in the system. Most fees are waived. More than half the young patients are referred for counseling because of aggressive, disruptive behavior. If their problems require medication, medical assistance is offered at the center or school. Professor Armbruster explained that these are children who live amid poverty, substance abuse and violence.
