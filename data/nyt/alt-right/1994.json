The family home was filled, he knew, with original furnishings from a house that was built from 1772 to 1774. The heiress grandly offered to him any of the contents he thought the historical society might want."}, {'slideshow_credits': None, 'byline': {'person': [{'lastname': 'POLK', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'original': 'By NANCY POLK'}, '_id': '4fd29ea58eb7c8105d88157c', 'pub_date': '1994-09-25T00:00:00Z', 'subsection_name': None, 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/25/nyregion/the-view-from-orange-acceptable-affordable-houses-in-an-affluent-neighborhood.html', 'word_count': '1021', 'news_desk': 'Connecticut Weekly Desk', 'snippet': 'TWO words, carrying ominous undertones of poverty pockets and an influx of "outsiders," strike fear in the hearts of Connecticut homeowners: affordable housing.
