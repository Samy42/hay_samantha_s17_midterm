Pride goes with the tradition. ''The National Guard today is better than it has ever been,'' says Maj. Gen. David W. Gay, the State Adjutant General and commander of the Guard. He cited a high level of training, education and physical fitness and continued: ''I think in terms of management, people, morale, equality, dealing with the public and our mission, we're doing as well as we can do.'' Members of the Guard can be found at parades, dedications and ceremonies, valued at state occasions because of their experience in managing large numbers of people. ''Not much happens in Connecticut without the thumbprint of the Guard,'' says General Gay. In addition to its official duties, the Guard volunteers for a wide variety of State functions -- the Nutmeg Games, Special Olympics and the Governor's Annual Care and Share food drive, among them. Though he supports some reduction of the Federal military budget he is troubled by the extent of the cuts he is seeing. ''There's been a 40 percent reduction in the Department of Defense budget since 1991,'' he said, ''which is starting to have a significant impact on us now.'' He said that the Guard was underfunded by $643 million in the current budget. ''We have a very ready National Guard. The danger is we will lose that readiness simply because of the dollars,'' he said. Currently the Guard receives only 5 percent, or $5 million, of its funding from the state. ''We're a great bounce for the buck in Connecticut,'' the General said. ''You can't give anything more than we can give for $5 million.'' Recently General Gay discussed some of his plans for the Guard in his office at the newly refurbished State Armory across from the Legislative Office Building in Hartford. Following are excerpts from that conversation. Q. How many people are in the Connecticut National Guard? A. There are about 6,500 airmen and soldiers, 4,200 in the Army Guard and about 1,500 in the Air National Guard. We are also responsible for four state militia units, the 1st and 2d Governors' Horse Guard and the 1st and 2d Governors' Foot Guard. That's another 300. The gender breakdown on the military side is about 17 percent women and it runs about the same for minorities, in the area of 15 to 17 percent. We've put a lot of effort into Hispanic and black recruiting. We've just recently celebrated Black History Month at the Union Baptist Church in Hartford. We had about 150 people there. Q. Do the National Guard and the Reserves have the same responsibilities? A. The Guard and the Reserves are different. We both have the same Federal mission and do our assigned Federal military mission as directed by the Federal military. In addition the National Guard has a state mission and can be called to active duty by the Governor for any natural disasters, as the Guards have done recently in Florida and California. We have an ongoing relationship with the Reserves particularly in terms of our N.C.O. Academy and our officer candidate school. We've had a long association with the Reserves here in Connecticut. Q. Is it a challenge to answer both the State and Federal authorities? A. It's easy because our mission on the military side is fully supported by the Governor. For instance, he supports all of our out-of-country training. We deal with the state in terms of facilities, ceremonial events, disasters or state needs. A significant portion of that is outside the duty day and not involved with the military at all. For example, we support Character Counts, the President's and Governor's Summit coming up June 20. Q. How does one get into the Guard? What are the conditions of service? A. Basically an 18-year-old who is physically and mentally fit is eligible. A 17-year-old can come in with a parent's signature. They are paid for all their military duty, 39 days a year, one weekend drill each month and two weeks of summer training. There are extensive additional requirements for special training exercises and education. They receive a salary for that. They sign up for eight years, which is the standard package, consisting of six years of active participation and two inactive participation. In Connecticut there is free college tuition to state colleges, state universities and state technical schools on a space-available basis. They also get paid for it. Depending on special programs like R.O.T.C. or prior service there may also be some G.I. Bill benefits. We have some 800 in college, saving something near $10,000 a year in tuition costs. When they graduate from college they may have two years of active commitment left. We find that many stay beyond that because they have advanced themselves either as an officer or as an enlisted person. Higher grades are a little more lucrative. Most newly graduating college students are in a transition area between employment and family and the need for an extra salary is important. We find that more than one-third of our people stay because they are patriotic and because they like the community goodwill association. I think the tuition and monetary benefits are second. The other thing is the camaraderie of organizations. People like to be in good organizations and we are physically fit and mentally alert and participating in the nation's and the state's business. That's attractive to a lot of people. Q. What are some recent missions? A. The Air National Guard was deployed to Bosnia on three occasions. The Air Control Squadron out of Orange has been over there twice and done a magnificent job. They are a radar unit and controlled all the aircraft in a block of the Mediterranean which included all the sorties flying over Bosnia. We are also very happy with their great drug missions in Columbia. They tracked drug aircraft in cooperation with the Colombian government. They did the same thing in the Bahamas. The Army Guard has trained all over the world. They have been in Japan, Korea, Germany, Philippines. We have an ongoing relationship with the land forces in Canada. A good portion of our units serve out of the country. Q. What does the Guard do in Connecticut? A. Any emergency over the last three or four years has been at the level that state agencies did not need any outside military support. We volunteered aircraft and generators to Upstate New York but they did not need them. The most recent case where we supported New York was with the fires on Long Island. We have the ability with aircraft to hit a lake, fill up a tank with water, drop it on a fire and do that every six minutes. Q. Is the Guard involved in drug prevention? A. We receive $600,000 from the national drug program. About half goes into youth programs for prevention. The other half goes into interdiction. We work with local drug task forces and Federal agencies like the F.B.I. In Bridgeport we have conducted customs inspections and cargo searches. We support about a dozen youth projects we developed ourselves. By the end of the year we have dealt with 12,000 to 15,000 youth in some aspect of our anti-drug programs. Most begin in middle school with fifth and sixth graders. We also go into high schools. We try to be in their lives before drug involvement. It is not only the educational product we are giving out. It is also an opportunity to see another life choice, military role models, people who have their heads on straight. In many cases we have been so successful that even though the National Guard budgets and staff have been reduced the communities are standing up and supporting us with funds. It has happened in Bridgeport, Groton and Waterbury. We also do unannounced drug testing of our own people throughout the year. Last year we tested 47 percent of the Army National Guard. The results were very good. We are the best in New England and in the top 10 in the nation. We finished last year somewhere below 3 percent hits. We have to be a drug-free organization. No. 1, we have a Federal and state mission that's important and I have the dependence of parents throughout Connecticut. I treat drug violations very rapidly and very harshly."}, {'slideshow_credits': None, 'byline': {'person': [{'lastname': 'POLK', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'original': 'By NANCY POLK'}, '_id': '4fd218538eb7c8105d794d5c', 'pub_date': '1998-04-05T00:00:00Z', 'subsection_name': None, 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/05/nyregion/q-a-elena-demurias-banker-to-museum-director-with-a-mission.html', 'word_count': '1391', 'news_desk': 'Connecticut Weekly Desk', 'snippet': 'WHEN the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport sought a new director in 1995, a startling 85 candidates applied.
