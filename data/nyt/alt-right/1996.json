On Feb. 11, 1995, a blustery cold day, two boys decided to explore the wide spot of a frozen river where New Haven meets Woodbridge. The ice broke. Across the street, John Willsher was telephoning the husband of a stranded motorist when he heard the screams. He ran to his truck to fetch strong rope, and although he crawled carefully across the ice, it gave way, plunging him into the frigid water. He grabbed one of the two boys, 7-year-old Brian Bates. Another boy, Kerone Smith, 9, wrapped the rope around himself and was dragged to the bank. The exertion plus the bitter cold was too much for Mr. Willsher. Just four days shy of his 58th birthday he had a heart attack and, despite efforts of paramedics, Mr. Willsher died on the river bank. John Willsher, the good samaritan, became a national hero. He was posthumously awarded the Carnegie Medal for extraordinary heroism. Newspapers, magazines and television carried the story of the immigrant plumber who gave his life to save two young boys.", 'headline': {'main': "Remembering a Hero, A Man Who Would 'Light Up a Party'", 'kicker': 'The View From: Woodbridge'}, 'section_name': 'New York and Region', 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/18/nyregion/remembering-a-hero-a-man-who-would-light-up-a-party.html', 'byline': {'person': [{'rank': 1, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'lastname': 'POLK'}], 'original': 'By NANCY POLK'}, 'print_page': '2', 'source': 'The New York Times', 'word_count': '1197', '_id': '4fd1d8d78eb7c8105d717e44', 'slideshow_credits': None, 'subsection_name': None, 'keywords': [{'value': 'WILLSHER, JOHN', 'name': 'persons'}, {'value': 'WOODBRIDGE (CONN)', 'name': 'glocations'}], 'document_type': 'article', 'snippet': "JOHN WILLSHER died a hero's death.
