Although 103 Connecticut towns have reported rabid animals in the last two years and the disease is spreading rapidly throughout the state, Dr. Maxine A. LeGeyt, a Vernon veterinarian and expert on rabies, said, "We\'re coping quite well. Other states are looking at Connecticut to see how to handle rabies." Fairfield County is completely saturated with the disease, Litchfield County heavily infected. Other parts of the state west of the Connecticut River are experiencing an upsurge in cases with the spring population boom, according to Dr. LeGeyt. More than 1,300 cases of rabies have been identified in wild and domestic animals throughout Connecticut since 1991. "We have been expecting rabies here since 1986," said the director of the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Association, Harry Shook. The disease has been traveling through the Middle Atlantic region since 1977. Though thousands of exposures have been counted nationally, not one case of human rabies has been identified because the post-exposure treatment is so effective, Dr. LeGeyt said. Ebbs and Flows The virus ebbs and flows in a cycle that depends on how fast the wildlife re-populates. Cases will decline first in the areas first affected, like Fairfield County.
