    "- You would need to create an API key.\n",
    "- Use `request` or `beautiful-soap` library to download the data. (No other library or crawler allowed).\n",
    "- Store the data in your local machine.\n",
    "- Your analysis should use **this downloaded data only** (and not try to redownload this data again during analysis time).\n",
    "-  There is a rate limit for downloading the data. I would suggest you to start collecting the data from day 1. You can try using multiple account to get more than 1 key.\n",
    "-  You need to use atleast 2 API method eg: `archive`, `Article Search`. **Do not use** `Movies Review`, `Semantic` API.\n",

    "I was intested in analysing this data set to help me understand the current dramatic political movement. I do not support the alt-right movement, but am interested in it's sudden appearance in media due to the Trump campaign and presidency. \n",

    "## Analysis \\# 1: Number of Articles Containing the term \"alt-right\" over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "I understand that the \"alt-right\" campaign has existed for quite some time, but hasn't been as vocal before they got a political canidate on their side. I wanted to see how bit a spike Trump caused and if there was a similar rise during the Obama campaign and presidency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, i searched for all articles that triggered the query \"alt-right\" using the New York Times Article Search API for the last 25 years. I stored each year's data in seprate json files, then plotted the number of results from each year in a bar chart.\n",

    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./img/altrightarticles.jpg \"Number of Articles Mentioning \\\"alt-right\\\" per year\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart was interesting to me for a number of reasons. First, the amount of artiles mentioning the alt-right sharply increased around the announcement of the Trump canidancy. This was to be expected, but the frequency more than doubled from the previous year and there was no gradual increase.\n",

    "## Analysis \\# 2: Number of Unique People Emailed Per Employee\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I wanted to see how many different people each employee would contact. To do this, I scanned all sent items from each employee's inbox and recorded all email addresses they contacted. I then removed the duplicates from this list to get the number of unique email addresses contacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./img/numepeople.jpg \"Histogram of Number of Unique People Contacted\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This histogram shows a vaguely exponential distribution with more people only contacting a few people and a few employees emailing large numbers of different email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis \\# 3: Average Number Times Each Person is Contacted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I wanted to see the average number of times each eployee contacted each person they communicated with. I scanned each employee's emails to find the email addresses of people they emailed. I took the average of this number across all emails for each employee and then plotted each employee's average contact rate on a historgram.\n",

    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./img/peopleperemail.jpg \"Histogram of Number of People Per Email\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This histogram is unimodal with few outliers. It has a mean of 2.057 people and a mode of rouchly the same value. This means that each employee contacts each other person, on average, two times. This indicates that employees often converse brifly with people outside their frequent contacts."
