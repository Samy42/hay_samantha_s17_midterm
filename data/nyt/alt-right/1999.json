Alone, as part of a chorus, chanting in prayer or in furious outbursts of wordless sound, the voice is a blessed paradox, for it uses the same medium as speech to allow us to escape the limits of language. As all musicians know, the voice's physical attributes define our most basic musical ideas: conductors routinely admonish orchestra players ''to breathe,'' ''to sing.'' The emotions we associate with music are all linked to vocalized sound -- loud, soft, harsh, lyrical -- as are most musical instruments, whose makers have long battled the inevitable tyranny of the voice. Sitars, temple blocks, shawms, pipe organs, accordions, saxophones and theremins (let alone synthesizers and computers) all acknowledge the primacy of the voice even when they avoid, amplify or distort it. Violinists like Paganini, Kreisler and Heifetz fought to produce the voice's ethereal illusion; guitarists use vibrato to emulate its warm tones; brass instruments find their most glorious sound when responding to choirs.
