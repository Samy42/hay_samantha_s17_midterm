The team sports of high school dominate more than student culture. A community's loyalty to the high school system is often based on the extent to which varsity teams succeed. High school administrators and faculty members are often former coaches, and the coaches themselves are placed in a separate, untouchable category. The result is that the culture of the inside elite is not contested by the adults in the school.

Alone, as part of a chorus, chanting in prayer or in furious outbursts of wordless sound, the voice is a blessed paradox, for it uses the same medium as speech to allow us to escape the limits of language. As all musicians know, the voice's physical attributes define our most basic musical ideas: conductors routinely admonish orchestra players ''to breathe,'' ''to sing.'' The emotions we associate with music are all linked to vocalized sound -- loud, soft, harsh, lyrical -- as are most musical instruments, whose makers have long battled the inevitable tyranny of the voice. Sitars, temple blocks, shawms, pipe organs, accordions, saxophones and theremins (let alone synthesizers and computers) all acknowledge the primacy of the voice even when they avoid, amplify or distort it. Violinists like Paganini, Kreisler and Heifetz fought to produce the voice's ethereal illusion; guitarists use vibrato to emulate its warm tones; brass instruments find their most glorious sound when responding to choirs. The piano, that upstart of modern manufacture, has sought an accommodation with the voice, at once providing a percussive accompaniment for vocal lyricism and luring pianists into the formidable task of simulating the voice's line."}, {'slideshow_credits': None, 'byline': {'person': [{'lastname': 'Botstein', 'firstname': 'Leon', 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'original': 'By Leon Botstein'}, '_id': '4fd230e88eb7c8105d7bfde6', 'pub_date': '1999-10-21T00:00:00Z', 'subsection_name': None, 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/21/opinion/80-minutes-no-miracle.html', 'word_count': '632', 'news_desk': 'Editorial Desk', 'snippet': 'Americans seem to have an inexhaustible penchant for collective self-delusion about how easy it is to improve schools.

''There has been explosive growth in women's rowing,'' Mr. Vespoli said. The Yale rowing coach, Dave Vogel, said rowing and soccer were the two fastest-growing women's sports in America. (Currently, Yale has 150 rowers of each sex.) Meanwhile, college scholarships linked to rowing are expanding for women, which in turn has caused the sport to grow at the high school level. (Twenty secondary schools in the state now offer rowing.)
