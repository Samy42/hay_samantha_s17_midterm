But the real danger is that if inheritance taxes are eliminated, the historic and unique character of American society and culture will be placed in jeopardy. From the start, we have been a nation struggling to balance two competing values: freedom and equality. James Madison, in his defense of the Constitution, admitted that the overriding purpose of government was to protect the unequal acquisition of property. Inequality in wealth resulted from the manner in which the natural inequalities among human beings played themselves out. But Madison shared the prejudices of philosophers from Aristotle to Locke regarding the limits to the right to property. Individuals were entitled to personal wealth and property as the legitimate fruit of labor and reason. Entitlement by birth, however, was not inherently healthy; it was the distinguishing feature of an aristocratic society.'}, {'slideshow_credits': None, 'byline': {'person': [{'lastname': 'Botstein', 'firstname': 'Leon', 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'original': 'By Leon Botstein'}, '_id': '4fd240198eb7c8105d7d79b7', 'pub_date': '2000-05-28T00:00:00Z', 'subsection_name': None, 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/28/opinion/a-tyranny-of-standardized-tests.html', 'word_count': '1168', 'news_desk': 'Editorial Desk', 'snippet': 'The good news about education has become obvious: the quality of public schools is now on center stage in national politics.

The mistrust of schools and teachers has become so widespread that the only politically viable solution seems to be to impose more standardized tests. Forty-nine states have now adopted curriculum standards that explicitly require testing in order to measure the performance of pupils, teachers, principals, and superintendents; by 2003, 26 states will have mandatory statewide tests for high school graduation.
