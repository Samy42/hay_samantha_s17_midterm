Most of the debate has centered on calculations about future tax revenues and notions about the role of government.

From the start, we have been a nation struggling to balance two competing values: freedom and equality. James Madison, in his defense of the Constitution, admitted that the overriding purpose of government was to protect the unequal acquisition of property. Inequality in wealth resulted from the manner in which the natural inequalities among human beings played themselves out. But Madison shared the prejudices of philosophers from Aristotle to Locke regarding the limits to the right to property. Individuals were entitled to personal wealth and property as the legitimate fruit of labor and reason.
