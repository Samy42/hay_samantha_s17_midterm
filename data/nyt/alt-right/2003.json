The problem with the way this debate is yet again being framed is that defenders and opponents of affirmative action alike fail to come to grips with a reasonable definition of merit. The truth is, the qualities that make an applicant deserving of admission to a selective university cannot be reduced to a single standard of measurement -- certainly not an SAT score or undergraduate grades -- nor can they be judged simply on the basis of skin color."}, {'slideshow_credits': None, 'byline': {'person': [{'lastname': 'POLK', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'original': 'By NANCY POLK'}, '_id': '4fd227cb8eb7c8105d7b06b9', 'pub_date': '2003-01-12T00:00:00Z', 'subsection_name': None, 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/nyregion/the-view-from-farmington-etched-in-stone-smallpox-memories.html', 'word_count': '1059', 'news_desk': 'Connecticut Weekly Desk', 'snippet': 'CONNECTICUT lists more than 40,000 buildings, one submarine and as of seven months ago, one rock, on its state historic registers.
