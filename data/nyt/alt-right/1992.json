After 23 years as a toll supervisor for the state he wanted to be outdoors doing something that was enjoyable and that would generate a modest income. He found it in vast fields of trumpet-shaped day lilies. Mr. Krupian, 76 years old, whom everyone calls Augie, breeds thousands of day lilies on quiet Bethmour Road in Bethany. "I loved roses but they were too much work," said Mr. Krupian who has bred day lilies for 12 years. "Day lilies are easy to cross and transplant, and they hardly have any disease or bug problems." The Krupian family grew up on a 96-acre dairy farm. Today the farm is a manageable 20 acres although it takes Mr. Krupian seven and a half hours riding on a mower to cut all the lawns. He remembers his father buying one of the first trucks in Bethany. He and his three siblings attended a one-room schoolhouse in town. "There were 10 dairy farms in those days, but now Bethany is a bedroom community for New Haven," he said. Farming for the Draft Dodger During World War II the Farm Bureau inspected farms to assess how many men were needed to supply food and how many could be spared for the draft. "The rich used to buy farms for their sons to keep them out of the Army," he recalled. "I enlisted. I wanted to get away from farming." Mr. Krupian ran a post exchange in Japan but said he was too independent to make the military a career. He returned to Bethany and a country life. The Krupians always had a huge vegetable garden. Over the last 12 years Mr. Krupian has gradually reduced the vegetables and allowed the day lilies to take over. Interspersed with the flowers are volunteer dill seedlings, rows of tomatoes and peppers, sweet potatoes and squash. He also raises apples and peaches, berries, peonies and cultivated varieties of wildflowers. As he weeds and divides his plants he whistles his favorite chamber music. Often butterflies and mocking birds, orioles and robins join him. Sometimes ruby-throated hummingbirds come to the bright flowers for nectar. His flower beds this summer were full of delicate lavender, soft pink and lemony yellow. He also raises vivid golds, earthy bronzes and assorted crimsons and scarlets. "When I started I liked vivid reds, like most men, but now I prefer softer colors like lavender, pale yellow and pink," he said. Season Not Over Yet Some of his clumps produce a new blossom each day for a month. Garden workhorses, day lilies bloom from mid-June to October. Mr. Krupian was working in a nursery in the 1950\'s when he spied his first deep-red day lily and was fascinated by its beauty. When he was offered a cutting in the middle of a searing hot summer day he could not believe it would flourish. He soon discovered that day lilies were virtually carefree and could tolerate midsummer transplanting. He inherited his gardening abilities from his mother. "She had a natural green thumb," he recalled. "She didn\'t know anything technically but everything she planted succeeded." The garden still holds many of her roses and trees. Mr. Krupian and his brother share a house on the spot where the original Krupian homestead stood. It had been offered to the fire department by a previous owner to burn down for practice. When the brothers moved back onto the family property they built their present house. Undemanding day lilies may be divided and planted any time of the year if the soil is workable and not frozen. Mr. Krupian buys stock to use for breeding and sells his original crosses and divisions. Most of his seedlings sell for $10 to $25, and the rarer varieties for $75. He prefers not to sell special plants to gardeners who do not know or do not care about their flowers. Recently he turned away a customer who needed flowers for her new rock garden. "Day lilies are much too large for a rock garden," he explained. He did recommend miniature hostas as more suitable. Abundance of Roadside Wildlings Connecticut is lavishly blessed with fulva, the ubiquitous orange wildling found along roadsides in midsummer. But Mr. Krupian is not enthusiastic about the wild day lilies. "We find them garish," he said. "No matter where they are planted they draw the eye and throw the rest of the garden out of kilter." His breeding goal is a sun-fast red. The darker reds, he explained, tend to fade in full sun while the brighter reds enjoy sunshine. He speculates about creating a blue day lily some day, but that will occur in a laboratory, he explained, with the blue color borrowed from another plant, perhaps a delphinium or even a wild chickory. To propagate his flowers he divides clumps; large clumps can be divided into several new plants. Some plants produce natural "baby plants" called proliferations, which he just snips and plants. Creating New Varieties To try new varieties Mr. Krupian chooses two attractive plants. He gathers the pollen from the anther of one plant and rubs it onto the pistil of another. If the hybrid is successful a seed pod forms. He allows it to ripen and then harvests the shiny black seeds, which he plants in trays of damp seed-starter and refrigerates for about six weeks. Since he has so many, his trays go to a greenhouse where he rents space but a sunny windowsill or fluorescent light tubes will also do. It takes patience. No flowers will appear for two years, he said, but then a new variety will be born with surprising results. Mr. Krupian said it was a simple process, one that he explains to his garden visitors several times each day. "They\'ll be pleased with the first blossom, then they become more discriminating," he said. His expert eye favors new varieties with clear color, a good bud count, vigorous branching, clean foliage and height in proportion to foliage, and no flowers on short stems hidden within their leaves. The man who has bred thousands of new plants himself said simply: "Anyone can do this. I do it because I\'m trying to get a good-looking flower." And he encourages success in his clients\' efforts. "If you come up with a great flower then more power to you."'}, {'slideshow_credits': None, 'byline': {'person': [{'lastname': 'POLK', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'original': 'By NANCY POLK'}, '_id': '541705b938f0d85fde3241df', 'pub_date': '1992-08-09T00:00:00Z', 'subsection_name': None, 'web_url': 'http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/nyregion/lumber-lattice-and-whimsy-form-outdoor-points-of-view.html', 'word_count': '1029', 'news_desk': 'Connecticut Weekly Desk', 'snippet': "SOME say ga-ZEE-bo, some say ga-ZAY-bo.
